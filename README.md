## Dependencies

LAST requires the following dependencies on your system to compile:

- `libgtk+-3.0`
- `x11`
- `libjansson`
- `luajit`

## Installation

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/wins1ey/LAST
cd LAST
make
sudo make install
```
or
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/wins1ey/LAST && cd LAST && make && sudo make install
```

## Getting Started

1. Launch LAST by executing the compiled binary. `./LAST`
2. When first launched, LAST will create the `LAST` directory in your config directory. Auto splitters, splits and themes go in their respective folders inside.
3. The initial window is undecorated, but you can toggle window decorations by pressing the right Control key.
4. Control the timer using the following key presses:

   | Key        | Stopped Action | Started Action |
   |------------|----------------|----------------|
   | Spacebar   | Start          | Split          |
   | Backspace  | Reset          | Stop           |
   | Delete     | Cancel         | -              |

- The "Cancel" action resets the timer and decrements the attempt counter. A run reset before the start delay is automatically cancelled.
- To manually modify the current split, use the following key actions:

   | Key         | Action        |
   |-------------|---------------|
   | Page Up     | Unsplit       |
   | Page Down   | Skip split    |

4. Customize keybindings by setting the values in `wildmouse.last` path with `gsettings`.

   | Key                        | Type    | Description                       |
   |----------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------|
   | start-decorated            | Boolean | Start with window decorations     |
   | hide-cursor                | Boolean | Hide cursor in window             |
   | global-hotkeys             | Boolean | Enables global hotkeys            |
   | theme                      | String  | Default theme name                |
   | theme-variant              | String  | Default theme variant             |
   | keybind-start-split        | String  | Start/split keybind               |
   | keybind-stop-reset         | String  | Stop/Reset keybind                |
   | keybind-cancel             | String  | Cancel keybind                    |
   | keybind-unsplit            | String  | Unsplit keybind                   |
   | keybind-skip-split         | String  | Skip split keybind                |
   | keybind-toggle-decorations | String  | Toggle window decorations keybind |

Keybind strings should be parseable by
[gtk_accelerator_parse](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/gtk3-Keyboard-Accelerators.html#gtk-accelerator-parse).

## Auto Splitters

LAST supports auto splitters written in Lua to automate split timing based on in-game events. When running LAST in the terminal you will initally be greeted with an auto splitter downloader which grabs them from [here](https://github.com/Wins1ey/LuaAutoSplitters). Feel free to make your own, Documentation can be found [here](./docs/AutoSplitters.md)

## Split Files

Split files in LAST are stored as well-formed JSON. The split file must contain a main object. The following keys are optional:

| Key           | Value                                 |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| title         | Title string at top of window         |
| start_delay   | Non-negative delay until timer starts |
| world_record  | Best known time                       |
| splits        | Array of split objects                |
| theme         | Window theme                          |
| theme_variant | Window theme variant                  |
| width         | Window width                          |
| height        | Window height                         |

Each split object within the `splits` array has the following keys:

| Key          | Value                  |
|--------------|------------------------|
| title        | Split title            |
| time         | Split time             |
| best_time    | Your best split time   |
| best_segment | Your best segment time |

Times are strings in HH:MM:SS.mmmmmm format

## Themes

LAST supports customizable themes, allowing you to personalize the timer's appearance. To create a theme:

1. Create a CSS stylesheet with your desired styles.
2. Place the stylesheet in the `~/.config/LAST/themes/<name>/<name>.css` directory. (If you have `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` env var pointing somewher else than .config it will be wherever it points to)
3. Set the global theme by modifying the `theme` value in `gsettings`.
4. Theme variants should follow the pattern `<name>-<variant>.css`.
5. Individual splits can apply their own themes by specifying a `theme` key in the main split object.

For a list of supported CSS properties, refer to the [GtkCssProvider](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkCssProvider.html) documentation.
